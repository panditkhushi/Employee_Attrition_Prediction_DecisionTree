# 🧑‍💼 Employee Attrition Prediction Using Decision Tree

## 📌 Project Overview
Employee attrition is a critical issue for organizations, leading to increased hiring costs and loss of experienced talent.  
This project focuses on predicting whether an employee is likely to leave the organization using a **Decision Tree classification model** based on HR analytics data.

The system helps HR departments identify potential attrition risks and take proactive measures to improve employee retention.


## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Predict employee attrition (Yes / No)
- Analyze key factors affecting attrition
- Build and evaluate a Decision Tree model
- Visualize decision rules and feature importance


## 📂 Dataset Information
**Dataset Name:** IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset  
**Source:** Kaggle
